The file "idp_with_new_boulder_dataset" contains the latest code for predicting the energy of the charging station per hour.
It consists of some data preprocessing and prediction results by using linear regression and xgboost models.
The dataset to be used for this is the "new_boulder_dataset.csv"
The file "idp_iterate_on_dates_for_loop" consist of the code used for granularizing the initial dataset to obtain the final "new

All other files are the initial work done for reaching to the final results
